  "description": [
    "My ML Lib is a Python library that contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms. The library is designed to be easy to use and understand, making it suitable for beginners and experts alike.",
    "The library includes algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more. Each algorithm is implemented from scratch, allowing users to see how the algorithms work under the hood.",
    "I built this library to learn more about machine learning algorithms and improve my programming skills. I also wanted to create a resource that others could use to learn about machine learning and experiment with different algorithms."
