    "CourseSphere is an AI-powered assistant for Cornell students that matches users to courses and professors based on their academic interests, previous backgrounds, goals, and other preferences.",
    "Students ask CourseSphere for the reviews of courses or professors, the research they do, what achievements and skills they will gain, and the prerequisites they need to have.",
    "Instead of spending hours reading up on those reviews on r/Cornell, RateMyProfessor, Cornell's roster page, and the course syllabus, students can now ask CourseSphere for the information they need and get it in seconds. We have loaded everything into a kowledge database."
