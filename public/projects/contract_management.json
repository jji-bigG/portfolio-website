    "The Contract Management System is a web application that allows users to create, sign, and manage contracts online. The app is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and uses JSON Web Tokens for authentication.",
    "Users can create contracts by filling out a form with details such as the parties involved, the terms of the contract, and the signature fields. Once a contract is created, users can send it to other parties for review and signature.",
    "The app also includes features for managing contracts, such as tracking the status of contracts, setting reminders for important dates, and archiving old contracts. Users can view and search for contracts, filter contracts by status, and generate reports on contract activity."
