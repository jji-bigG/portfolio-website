    "This allows us to reduce redundant work in writing PDF contracts, sending them to clients, and tracking their signing status. It makes the entire process more efficient and more authoritative for clients to trust.",
    "The app also includes features for managing contracts, such as tracking the status of contracts, setting reminders for important dates, and archiving old contracts. Users can view and search for contracts, filter contracts by status, and generate reports on contract activity."
